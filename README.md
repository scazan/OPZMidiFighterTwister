# OP-Z Midi Fighter Twister Configuration

My Midi Twister configuration for playing the OP-Z

A work in progress. Each track is mapped to two columns of the Twister with volume at the bottom right of each two columns.
Bank 1-3 can be accessed by the left-side buttons. Currently only the synth tracks are mapped (bass, lead, arpeggiator, chord) with the parameters that I usually need access to for live performance.
